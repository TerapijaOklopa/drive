    Android Homework
</h1>

Thank you for considering us as a team you want to join. We are looking forward to getting to know you.

This is a short test to see how you work and what you know, and it will set a base for your following interviews. You have **7 days** to complete this assignment starting when you receive the repo invite. If you can't finish everything in this timeframe, please let us know.

Design, internal structure, and application flow are entirely up to you. The usage of 3rd party libraries is encouraged and if you want to include some advanced patterns (ex., DI, annotation processing, dynamic features, compose, coroutines), feel free to do so. The only requirement is for the app to be written in Kotlin.

Commit and push your final solution to the main branch of this project and send us an email once everything is ready for review. Feel free to email us at mobile.experience@smallpdf.com if you have any questions or need further clarification.

## **User story:**

The app should solve the following problem:

## Expectations:
- Build a simple app around the Google Drive integration for Android.
- Build a robust, testable, and scalable architecture (fit for large-scale projects)
- Employ good Coding practices (documentation, testing, usage of git, etc.)
- Pay attention to the usability of the app
